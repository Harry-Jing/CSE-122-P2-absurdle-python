I created this project to enhance my personal skills. Through this project, I aim to test and improve the following tools:

+ The use of Git
  - git hooks
  - add, commit, brunch, merge, rebase and so on
  - deal with merge conflic
+ The function in Github
  - github action
  - github app: `pre-commit` and `Codecov`
  - pull request / pullrequest draft
+ Using `pytest` for code testing, aiming to achieve 100% coverage. Hope this will help in developing a habit of writing comprehensive test codes that cover all aspects.
+ Reflect on and augment my proficiency in writing Python code
